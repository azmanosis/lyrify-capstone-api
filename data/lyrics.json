understand the harsh feedback\nMy head nod only suits the beat\nAccording to the old common sense, career is the official position, and seniors are everything, boy\nIs time a fund? Go bankrupt, quickly, boy\nCall the hyungs, the boss is fine too\nAs my head gets bigger, your heart gets scared\n\nKilling hip-hop is easy, right?\n20-year-olds with 18-year-old sensibility\nE'erybody sound the same\nCommercialize the game and she's dead (show time)\nDo you think there is no up or down because you only say the right things?\nIf my words are irritating then you just chew on Bobby\nWhen I catch Michael, it's a thriller to the audience\nWhen you grab the mic, even the pigeon leaves, uh\n\nWow, look here\nCowards run away on their own\nNo doubt, are you watching?\nIf I twist it, do you guys do it too?\nUh, hide tight\nShow me your hair\nWhere to look, the scale is different here\nMothafuckin' do or die\n\nYo, how far am I going\nWatch it at home on TV, stupid\nYo, wherever I was and what I was doing\nBetter than you guys who stay still, stupid\nMachines that look the same are installed on the stage\nI'll just say one thing, that's \"No, no\"\nTo haters who point fingers at donations\nI'll just say one thing, that's \"No, no\""}
